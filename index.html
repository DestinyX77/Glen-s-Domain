        <h1>Glen's Personal Domain</h1>
        <p> Hello. If you're seeing this, then that means you are <b>trespassing</b> my personal profile page. Fear not, I'll give you permission to enter this domain of mine and promise me to not spread rumors of me</p>
        <hr> 
        <h2> About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Glen Owen. I'm 18 years old. My dorm is at DK Senza, and I am single. I study at Taylor's University, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke and drink. I'm in bed by 11-12 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are not as much as I have in my previous life as a highschool student. I don't play games as much as I do, for now I only play Minecraft. I watched animes but not as much as I did in the past. Recently I just found a new hobby called <b>gunpla building</b>. It's basically building a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam>gundam</a> model from plastic runners. It is a fun and expensive hobby, I enjoy building gunplas.</p>
        <p> I have a lot of list of gunplas that I wanted to buy and build, such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/144 RG Gundam Astray Red Frame</li>
            <li>1/144 RG RX-78-2 Gundam</li>
            <li>1/144 RG MS-06S Zaku II Char Aznable Custom Model</li>
            <li>1/144 RG RX-93 NU Gundam</li>
            <li>1/144 MSN-04 Sazabi</li>
            <li>and more...</li>
        </ul>
        <p> I also draw a lot, but I only do it in my sketchbook. There are a lot of stuff I drew in my sketchbook and I wish I had the confidence to show it to my class. My favorite theme when I draw is fantasy because I can draw anything I wanted based on my imagination :D.</p>

        <h2>My Profile :D</h2>
        <img src="images/Me and my alter-ego, Guren.jpg" title="Me and my imaginary friend, Guren">
        <p> On top of this paragraph, you can see me and my imaginary friend, Guren, back in my highschool time. I just thought it would be cool if I drew my imaginary friend beside me so I could show it to people around me how he looks like. You might be wondering why I still had an imaginary friend although people said that imaginary friends are just for <i>kids</i>. My imaginary friend is designed based on my lack of trust and lack of <i>true friend</i>. It might sound ridiculous because I may have friends around me, but I always overthink that they may abandon me and see me as that one backup friend or <i>the second choice</i>.</p>
        <p> In case if someone wanted to know if I had an Instagram account, here's the link to my <a href=https://www.instagram.com/glenowen77>art account</a>. I only share my personal account to only those who I know and trust(?).</p>

        <h2>End of Page</h2>
        <p> Wow. I can't believe you really arrived to the end of this page. I must admit you are one of the people who really want to know me. I guess I should give you a thanks and an apologise too. Thank you for reading this page with your interest and sorry for wasting your time reading this page about me, I know I sound cringe but it is what <i>I</i>am supposed to be</p>
